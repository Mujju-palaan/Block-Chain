Establishing trust in a Blockchain:
Secure chain using protocols
Validate transactions & blocks
Verify availability of resources
Executing & confirming transactions

 
Proof of Work:
First, compute the hash of the block header elements that is a fixed value, and the nonce that is a variable.
If hash value is less than 2 par 128 for bitcoin, and less than function of difficulty for Ethereum, 
the puzzle has been solved. If it has not been solved, repeat the process after changing the nonce value.
If the puzzle has been solved, broadcast the winning block that will be verified by other miners.
Non-winning miner nodes add the new block to the local copy of the chain, and move on to working on the next block.

So this is your opportunity if you are a student who isn’t represented by a lot of people that look like you or think like you. 
This is your shot. You can get in there and say No, I’m the expert, I’m the master on this, and that’s good.

With a very low probability, the main chain may split but if it does, the bitcoin protocol has methods to 
consolidate it to a single chain within a cycle. 



Fork
A permanent divergence in the block chain, commonly occurs when non-upgraded nodes cannot validate blocks 
created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules。
区块链发生永久性分歧，在新共识规则发布后，部分没有升级的节点无法验证已经升级的节点生产的区块，通常硬分叉就会发生。

A temporary fork in the block chain which commonly occurs when miners using non-upgraded nodes violate a new 
consensus rule their nodes don’t know about.
当新共识规则发布后，没有升级的节点会因为不知道新共识规则下，而生产不合法的区块，就会产生临时性分叉。
