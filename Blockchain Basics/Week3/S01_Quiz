1.Question 1
A popular public-private key implementation known as Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) algorithm is used for the Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchain. True or False?


False  [Correct]


True

Correct
Correct!

1 / 1 point

2.Question 2
For the simple symmetric key example discussed in the lecture, it is easy to derive the “secret” key from the encrypted data. True or False?


False


True [Correct]

Correct
Correct! Please note that symmetric keys have other issues such (i) key distribution -- how do you send the key to the parties involved (ii) you need to create different secret key for different receivers, you cannot share the same key with different participants.

On the contrary, in a public-key encryption, you can publish the public key for any participant to use and not reveal the private key.

1 / 1 point

3.Question 3
256 bit ECC key-pair is equivalent in strength to approximately 3072-bit RSA key-pair. Thus ECC is much stronger encryption than RSA method. True or False?


False


True [Correct]

Correct!
